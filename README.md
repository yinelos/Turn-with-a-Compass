You receive the direction you are `facing` (one of the 8 directions: `N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW`) and a certain degree to `turn` (a multiple of 45, between -1080 and 1080); positive means clockwise, and negative means counter-clockwise.

Return the direction you will face after the turn.

## Examples:
```
"S",  180  -->  "N"
"SE", -45  -->  "E"
"W",  495  -->  "NE"
```
